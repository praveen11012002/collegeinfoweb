                <p>The relationship between JMC and nature is a long and enduring one,
                    something that students and staff of the college are aware of. The buildings
                    of this educational institution stand on the solid rock of the Aravalli range, a
                    topographical feature that the Congregation has consciously chosen to
                    preserve and protect. JMC is very often recognized as the college with huge
                    rocks jutting from the concrete giving it a completely natural and organic
                    facade.
                    Since 1968, the college has always had sustainable initiatives at the core of
                    all activities. 11.88% of the 14.1acre lush campus in the Diplomatic Enclave
                    has been built up. The rest of the campus can be categorized as playgrounds,
                    lawns and gardens. A huge area is left in its natural form and acts as a natural
                    habitat for biodiversity and a large variety of species of grasses, herbs, shrubs
                    and trees.</p>

                <ul><li>To foster a fondness for Tamil and advance the language proficiency</li>

                   engineering studies, meritorious sports students are offered 100% scholarship 
                   for perusing their studies without financial burden. Students are continually
                    motivated to participate in Anna university tournaments & Open tournaments.
                     All these efforts are made for making the students to be healthy and mould
                      them as the best citizens of the nation.</p>
